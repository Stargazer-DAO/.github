# **Stargazer MVP**

Stargazer MVP is a platform designed to enhance the functionality and accessibility of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains. It offers two main features: a platform for ENS owners to wrap their domains and sell subdomains, and an API aggregator for B2C platforms to integrate ENS services.


## **Platform for ENS Owners**

Stargazer allows ENS domain owners to easily set the sales cost for their subdomains and wrap their ENS domains for sale. Customers can purchase subdomains using ETH from their wallets, covering the sales cost, gas fee, and Stargazer fee. The platform ensures that all subdomains are emancipated, independently controlled, and managed by their respective owners.

Key Features:



* ENS domain owners can transfer and use their assets as desired.
* Owners can close the subdomain sales option or change the sales cost of their ENS domains.


## **API for B2C Platforms**

Stargazer provides an API that aggregates ENS domain offerings from various platforms, including immediate sale offers, available domains for registration, and subdomains available for paid or unpaid creation. End users can easily search for ENS domains and subdomains using autocomplete features, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Key Features:



* Integration with B2C platforms, enabling users to purchase ENS domains and subdomains using supported cryptocurrencies or connected payment gateways.
* Management of Stargazer fees and fees charged by each connected B2C provider.

Please note that more detailed descriptions and UI/UX prototypes will be available soon.
